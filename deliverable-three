## 1: System Description

The problem with multiple different music streaming platforms causes issues with listeners who use more than one, since not all have the preferred structure, library, or versions of songs. For listeners of music in the internet age, who don't want to deal with hopping between streaming platforms to enjoy specific tracks or songs. LilyPad is a new web app music platform that connects all of your streaming accounts together, unlike the current popular streaming platforms, our product gives you a way to listen your favorite songs, all in one place. LilyPad is a website app that provides avid music listeners with an easy way to link all their favorite songs and playlists, across multiple platforms, ensuring you never need to go to more than one place for your favorite music ever again.

Through LilyPad, Users will be able to listen to music from any of the platforms that they have accounts on and have linked, including Spotify, Youtube Music, and Apple Music. Individual users will also be capable of building their own playlists, sourcing songs from a variety of platforms. Users will also be able to search for playlists that other users have created on LilyPad, and a search functionality will also allow users to find any version of a song that they want to listen to. There will also be a favorite feature that users can apply to other users who share similar tastes, and on songs that users like more than other versions. With the capability that LilyPad provides, users will also have the power to convert a playlist that they had made on a single platform onto another platform, or convert it to a LilyPad specific playlist.
