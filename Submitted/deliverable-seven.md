## 1: Description
LilyPad is a website that provides listeners with a single place to link together their favorite songs, playlists, platforms, and artists. The site provides users a way to search for songs, put them into their own playlists, and listen to them. The unique factor of LilyPad comes from the fact that it connects all the popular platforms together, meaning songs exclusive to Spotify can appear in playlists right alongside songs from Youtube and Apple Music.

## 2: Verification (tests)
### 2.1: Unit Test

### 2.2: Acceptance Test
  2.2.1: Cypress JS
  2.2.2: https://github.com/CS386Team6/LilyPad/tree/main/cypress/e2e
  2.2.3: This test is responsible for making sure that the user is able to create a playlist correctly when logged in, but not when logged out. There are two different            tests that both require going to the playlist page of the site and attempting to create a playlist. The only difference is the first test runs without logging            in and ultimately does not create a playlist, whereas the second test logs in first.
