## 1: Description
LilyPad is a website that provides listeners with a single place to link together their favorite songs, playlists, platforms, and artists. The site provides users a way to search for songs, put them into their own playlists, and listen to them. The unique factor of LilyPad comes from the fact that it connects all the popular platforms together, meaning songs exclusive to Spotify can appear in playlists right alongside songs from Youtube and Apple Music.
