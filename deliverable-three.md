## 1: System Description

The problem with multiple different music streaming platforms causes issues with listeners who use more than one, since not all have the preferred structure, library, or versions of songs. For listeners of music in the internet age, who don't want to deal with hopping between streaming platforms to enjoy specific tracks or songs. LilyPad is a new web app music platform that connects all of your streaming accounts together, unlike the current popular streaming platforms, our product gives you a way to listen your favorite songs, all in one place. LilyPad is a website app that provides avid music listeners with an easy way to link all their favorite songs and playlists, across multiple platforms, ensuring you never need to go to more than one place for your favorite music ever again.

Through LilyPad, **guest users** will be able to **_listen_** to **songs** from any of the platforms that they have **external accounts** on and have linked, including Spotify, Youtube Music, and Apple Music. **Account users** will also be capable of _creating_ their own **playlists**, sourcing **songs** from a variety of **platforms**. **Account users** will also be able to _**search**_ for **playlists** that other **users** have _**created**_ on LilyPad, and a search functionality will also allow **users** to find any version of a **song** that they want to _**listen**_ to. Both of these search functionalities will be supplemented by an optional **filter** to refine results. With the capability that LilyPad provides, **users** will also have the power to _**convert**_ a **playlist** that they had made on a single **platform** onto another platform, or _**convert**_ it to a LilyPad specific **playlist**. The **music player** that **users** _**listen**_ to **songs** through will provide a _shuffle_ feature, as well as _customizations_.
