## 1: Introduction
LilyPad is a website that provides listeners with a single place to link together their favorite songs, playlists, platforms, and artists. The site provides users a way to search for songs, put them into their own playlists, and listen to them. The unique factor of LilyPad comes from the fact that it connects all the popular platforms together, meaning songs exclusive to Spotify can appear in playlists right alongside songs from Youtube and Apple Music.

## 3: Tests

### 3.1: Test Framework
We chose to use Cypress for automated tests, since Next.JS, the framework we are using, had documentation for its use on its home site.

### 3.2: GitHub Tests Folder Link

## 4: Adopted Technologies
We are building a web app with Node.JS, using a Next.JS framework. We chose this framework since it was easy to set up and some members had previous experience working with it.

For our database, we are using a PostgreSQL server hosted on Supabase, with server interaction though Prisma, a JavaScript library. 

Additional libraries include dotenv for integration and use of .env variables, react library functions for more robust pages, and node fetch, to make api requests.

## 5: Learning/Training
Documentation on Next.JS, Udemy courses focusing on web development, W3Schools, and Stack Overflow have all proven exceptionally helpful for learning these technologies, and overcoming errors faced during development.

## 6: Deployment
Currently, we are hosting our website on a server, with an unrelated domain name. Until we start closing in on a finished product, LilyPad will be hosted at: WEBSITE_NAME.

## 7: Licensing
We chose the GNU General Public License v3.0 for our code. Open source is important, but there may be future releases that we wish to make and keep closed-source. Since this license specifically covers that, it is perfect for our needs.
