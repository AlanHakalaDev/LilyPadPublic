# CS386 Team 6 Deliverable 1

## Introduction
  Our project, currently untitled, will be a website application for transferring playlists between popular music platforms. Starting with functionality for Spotify, Youtube Music, and Apple Music, our website will provide users a way to easily and quickly transfer playlists they have made on one platform to another, providing they have the necessary account permissions on both platforms. In the age of the internet, sharing music has become much less of a passive activity, as headphones and private listening devices provide songs on demand exclusively for the individual. However, sharing music with other people remains a unique way of connecting. One major problem can arise, however. With the onset of digital music streaming, finding and listening to songs on demand has never been easier, except when it comes to sharing those songs with a person who primarily listens on a different platform. Our website will allow users to bypass this obstacle quickly, easily, and for free.

## Initial Value Proposition and Customer Segments
  The web app we are creating will allow individuals to copy their playlists from one music platform onto another. Suppose you want to share your favorite songs with a friend, but they don’t have a Spotify account like you do. Our website will allow you to change it into a playlist for another platform, like Apple Music, Youtube Music, or some other platform your friend uses.
	This project will be for anyone who enjoys music digitally and cares to share their music tastes with others in the digital age of streaming services. Converting playlists between platforms right now is a hassle, and is quite labor-intensive. Our project will solve this issue.

Representative Quotes:

I: “You said you have playlists on both YouTube and Spotify for music, have you ever wanted to bring one playlist from one platform to the other?”

“Kind of, a lot of the songs are the same anyways so it wouldn’t be all that useful”

I: “Would you be more interested in transferring in one direction to the other?”

“Probably from YouTube to Spotify, YouTube has all the songs I have on Spotify, but there’s a lot of stuff from small artists and remixes on YouTube that aren’t on Spotify”

I: “Would the transfer of songs not on one platform to the other be the most useful aspect of the software for you?”

“Yeah that's probably all I would use it for”

Assessment: At first interview was only interested on a “nice to have” level at first, became much more interested when the idea of transferring songs not on one platform to another was introduced.

-Interviewee stated that he would be suspicious about giving his username and password to a random website

Representative Quotes: (I: denotes interviewer)

“So how would the thing actually get my playlist?”

I: “You would provide the website information like what platform you’re using, what your account username is, and what playlist you want transferred”

“On Spotify and YouTube I have my account set to private, so other people can’t see the songs in my playlist, would that mean I would have to log in to transfer a playlist?”

I: “If you were to have to login to a website with your account, would you feel comfortable doing so?”

“Maybe, if I knew the sight was trustable then I guess, I would be kind of worried about logging in with my store’s spotify account”

…

I: “Which platform has the playlists you want to transfer the most?”

“Probably soundcloud or YouTube music, soundcloud has a lot of unreleased stuff I like to listen to that isn’t on Spotify or gets taken down on youtube.”

Assessment: User views main part of software as “nice to have” and is significantly more interested in the idea of playing his music from different platforms all in one place.

Representative Quotes: 
“Sometimes there are uploads on one platform that are two songs on a single track, because they pair together as the artist intended. On spotify, though, they usually aren’t put together and it makes listening to those songs not as enjoyable”

### Rino De Guzman:

#### Interview 1: 

Who: Rose Aco

Rose primarily listens to music on her iPhone but also listens to music through her macbook.
She uses Spotify exclusively on her phone but uses both spotify and Youtube on her computer, iPad, and Google home.
She has playlists on Spotify but **not** on YouTube.
Interviewee was not interested in the idea of transferring from spotify to youtube
Due to the fact that there are youtube ads and there would be ads during her music session
Interviewee claimed a “playlist transfer tool” would be nice to have if the playlist she would be transferring from YouTube to Spotify is less than 60 songs.
If the playlist she wants to transfer from youtube to spotify is greater than 60 songs she would say that the “playlist transfer tool” would be a must have.
Interviewee would prefer to access the tool through the computer and not the website

Representative Quotes: 
“Through what device would you like to access a playlist transfer tool?”
“I would prefer to access the tool through my laptop or a computer on like a website or something”
“How do you feel about a tool that would allow you to transfer your playlists from spotify to youtube?”
“ I would not be interested, to me it is kind of pointless to transfer any of my playlists from spotify to youtube because I do not have youtube premium so if I listened to my playlist on youtube then I would have ads popping up while in spotify I can just listen without ads”

transfer. A must have if there are greater than 60 songs in the playlist to 
transfer.

always been using Spotify."

### Gannon Rowlan:

#### Interview 1:

Interview: Anders Poulsen

Customer Segment: A college student at Northern Arizona University.

When: 7:00pm, February 10, 2023

Key Insights:

-He is a big fan of music and uses multiple music apps to listen everyday.
-Anders uses four different apps: Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Amazon Music.
-He doesn’t really use his computer to listen to music but since most apps are linked through all devices, he agrees it would be of use.
-Although he likes the idea, he feels it may have already been done multiple times and may not startup fast.


Representative Quotes:

--“I feel like the idea is a bit generic and I would be able to find the exact same thing on the internet already. If there was another cool feature about it then it would be more worthwhile to use.”

-“It would definitely be nice if it could convert between more than two apps. I have four different apps and I would like to convert between all of them.”

-“It’s not like I would use it on a daily basis, but it would be nice to have every once in a while. Although, I wouldn’t pay for it.”

Assessment: Nice to have


#### Interview 2:

Interviewee: Mason Lundin

Customer Segment: A college student at Northern Arizona University.

When: 5:15pm, February 10, 2023

Key Insights:

-Mason uses a Macbook so he would like to be apple to convert between Spotify and Apple Music, as those are the only two he uses.
-He always listens to music on the way to classes and will always have airpods in when at home.
-He feels that as long as it is free to use, it would be nice to have. Another point that was brought up was transfering your own music files onto these different apps.


Representative Quotes: (I: denotes interviewer)

-“As long as it can take a playlist from my Spotify to my Apple Music, I’ll take it.”

-“I think you could also do a multipurpose app that also allows people to upload or convert their own music to different apps. If that is even allowed, that is.”

-“I don’t think it would be beneficial to make people pay for it though. A subscription just wouldn’t be worth it as it’s not a tool you would use very many times in a month. Having a flat price for converting playlists may be interesting but that could backfire as people still may not want to pay.”

Assessment: Nice to have

## Final Value Proposition and Customer Segments

Based on information gathered from the interview a playlist converter is a bit too narrow and a single use tool for most people. Users seemed most interested in the possibility of having a playlist composed of music that is exclusive to different platforms all in one place. A music hub that allows users to play music and make playlists from a variety of platforms seems to fit what our typical user would be most interested in.

Most people who use a streaming service have run into the problem of not being able to find the specific song they want on that platform when it is present on another, our software provides a simple solution by allowing users to listen to anything they want from anywhere all in one place. Our software solves a problem almost all music listeners who use streaming services face, but appeals specifically to more dedicated music fans who enjoy listening to remixes, unreleased music, and music from smaller artists that is not able to be found on large streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.
