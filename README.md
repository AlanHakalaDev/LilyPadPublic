Interviewee was most interested in the idea of transferring music not on Spotify from YouTube to Spotify.

Representative Quotes:

I: “You said you have playlists on both YouTube and Spotify for music, have you ever wanted to bring one playlist from one platform to the other?”

“Kind of, a lot of the songs are the same anyways so it wouldn’t be all that useful”

I: “Would you be more interested in transferring in one direction to the other?”

“Probably from YouTube to Spotify, YouTube has all the songs I have on Spotify, but there’s a lot of stuff from small artists and remixes on YouTube that aren’t on Spotify”

I: “Would the transfer of songs not on one platform to the other be the most useful aspect of the software for you?”

“Yeah that's probably all I would use it for”

Assessment: At first interview was only interested on a “nice to have” level at first, became much more interested when the idea of transferring songs not on one platform to another was introduced.

Key Insights:

Interviewee pays for YouTube Music, borrows a friend’s Spotify subscription, and uses soundcloud for free. 
Interviewee expressed interest only in transferring music from soundcloud to YouTube Music, from sound cloud to spotify, and YouTube music to spotify. 
Similar to the previous interview, the interviewee was most interested by the prospect of having songs not on spotify from another platform on his spotify playlist.
Interviewee asked if he would be required to login to spotify to make use of the software, since his spotify account is private and his playlist information is not immediately available.
Interviewee stated that he would be suspicious about giving his username and password to a random website

Representative Quotes: (I: denotes interviewer)

“So how would the thing actually get my playlist?”

I: “You would provide the website information like what platform you’re using, what your account username is, and what playlist you want transferred”

“On Spotify and YouTube I have my account set to private, so other people can’t see the songs in my playlist, would that mean I would have to log in to transfer a playlist?”

I: “If you were to have to login to a website with your account, would you feel comfortable doing so?”

“Maybe, if I knew the sight was trustable then I guess, I would be kind of worried about logging in with my store’s spotify account”

…

I: “Which platform has the playlists you want to transfer the most?”

“Probably soundcloud or YouTube music, soundcloud has a lot of unreleased stuff I like to listen to that isn’t on Spotify or gets taken down on youtube.”

Assessment: User views main part of software as “nice to have” and is significantly more interested in the idea of playing his music from different platforms all in one place.
