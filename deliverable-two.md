## 1: Positioning

### 1.1: Problem Statement

The problem with multiple different music streaming platforms causes issues with listeners who use more than one, since not all have the preferred structure, library, or versions of songs.

### 1.2: Product Position Statement

For listeners of music in the internet age, who don't want to deal with hopping between streaming platforms to enjoy specific tracks or songs. PROJECT_NAME is a new web app music platform that connects all of your streaming accounts together. Unlike the current popular streaming platforms, our product gives you a way to listen to your favorite songs, all in one place.

### 1.3: Value Proposition and Customer Segment

## 3: Functional Requirements

#### 1. Listen to tracks from connected platforms

#### 2. Create playlists using individual tracks from different platforms

#### 3. Convert playlists from one platform to another

#### 4. Favorite specific versions of songs that may only appear on one platform

#### 5. Un-favorite versions of songs that you don't like as much as others

#### 3. ADD_MORE_AS_NEEDED

## 4: Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Reusability
Listening to music demands the ability to reuse and re-listen to favorite songs. Coming back to the site in a day or in a year shouldn't matter, the site should still have your account and the playlists you've made.

#### 2. Security
Dealing with multiple accounts for platforms that may hold sensitive information, security is a must. We will use OAuth2 verification to ensure secure account creation and connection.

#### 3. Maintainability
Since users might be using this web app for a long time in the future, the ability to maintain the site will be necessary as well. To achieve this, we will aim for readable code, and consistent comments throughout.

#### 4. ADD_MORE_AS_NEEDED

## 5: MVP

The minimum viable product for this project will have the baseline functionality to connect multiple streaming platform accounts together. The connected music platforms account will be linked to the account created for the site. This will allow a user to listen to songs from multiple different platforms, and different versions, without needing to go to the respective app/site. The music player itself will have a universal style, regardless of the individual song's platform of origin. A play/pause button will be required, skip, rewind, and "view other versions" will all be part of the music player.
